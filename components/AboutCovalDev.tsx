                Before starting Coval, I led the evaluation job infrastructure team at Waymo. I coded the first versions of our dataset storage and other foundational simulation systems, and my team built all of the dev tools for launching and running evals.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Journey</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Through my conversations with hundreds of engineering teams at startups and enterprises, I've seen that AI agentsâ€”models that operate independently and handle complex tasksâ€”are facing similar challenges to those in self-driving.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In the early days, autonomous vehicle companies relied heavily on manual evaluation, testing the self-driving cars on racetracks and city streets (remember when autonomous cars still had safety drivers?). However, as startups scaled, a significant shift happened: we moved towards simulating every code change in a "virtual" environment, using the vast amounts of data we collected. The new approach dramatically improved vehicle behavior, leading to hundreds of autonomous cars zipping around the San Francisco streets today!
          </p>
          <p>
            This story mirrors what's happening today with AI agents across various industries. Teams are coming up with promising prototypes but often hit a wall when it comes to their reliability.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            As we build for the future, where AI agents execute much of our work, ranging from sending emails to prescribing medication, the risks posed by untested systems could severely throttle the progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Waymo, I developed tools that tested each code modification made by engineers, ensuring that every change improved the Waymo Driver's performance. I believe this methodical approach was key in helping our team address edge cases and maintain peak performance, and it ultimately cemented Waymo's status as a leader in the autonomous vehicle space.
